## Problem
Data Quality Issues

## Solution
1. Fix data in the source system: 
Data quality issues can usually be resolved by cleaning up the original source. "Garbage in, garbage out" holds true here, as incorrect or incomplete source data can corrupt the database and lead to poor results. Fixing data at the source system is often the most effective way to ensure good customer experiences and accurate analysis.

2. Fix the source system to correct data issues: 
The source system that gathers data can be configured to clean the data automatically before storing it in the database. It's ideal to set up your source system, such as a website, to automatically address data problems. Although it's not completely hands-off, it's very close to it.

3. Accept bad source data and fix issues during the ETL phase:
Before customer data can be analyzed, it’s frequently put through an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process. If you’re able to fix data in this stage, before it enters the database, you can solve a number of data quality errors.

4. Apply precision identity/entity resolution:
Precision identity/entity resolution is a challenging yet highly effective way to address data quality problems. Many customer databases suffer from multiple records for the same customer/household, without any connection between them. By employing this method, you can accurately identify customers/households across different variations, enabling more focused and efficient marketing. This prevents sending duplicate offers to the same customer and avoids targeting multiple individuals within a single household.

## Problem
1. Finding and Fixing Data Quality Issues
2. Long Response Times from System
3. Confusion with Big Data Tool Selection
4. Real Time Big Data Problems
5. Lack of Understanding
6. High Cost of Data Solutions
7. Too Many Choices
8. Complex Systems for Managing Data
9. Security Gaps
10. Low Quality and Inaccurate Data
11. Compliance Hurdles
12. Using Data for Meaning

14. Accessibility
15. Pace of Technology
16. Lack of Skilled Workers
17. Data Integration
18. Processing Large Data Sets
19. Constantly Changing Data

## Solution
1. During the data lifecycle, you must also maintain data properly so that it can be used by the right team at any point in time for application. This data usage is what breeds decision-making abilities. To learn how to keep data clean and reduce data quality issues

2. One way to fix long response times from your system is to ensure that data is being stored efficiently by performing data re-engineering. Or, look for a more optimised data system that’s scalable for your growing data needs.

3. it’s best to take time performing research and not jump too quickly into a specific tool. Additionally, be sure to review what kind of support the tools you’re considering offer.

4. A surefire way to overcome real-time big data issues is to deploy an automation solution that utilises artificial intelligence (AI) to process, analyse, and structure data in real-time. By doing so, you can avoid big data problems at every turn.

5. One way to combat the slow adoption is to take a top-down approach for introducing and training your organisation on data usage and procedures. If your in-house team doesn’t have the resources to take this on, consider bringing in IT specialists or consultants and holding workshops to educate your organisation.

6. To make the most informed decision for what kind of data solution will provide the most ROI, first consider how and why you want to use data. Then, align your reasoning with your business goals, conduct research for available solutions, and implement a strategic plan to incorporate it into your organisation.

7. Like understanding data, a good solution is to leverage the experience of your in-house expert, perhaps a CTO. If that’s not an option, hire a consultancy firm to assist in the decision-making process. Use the internet and forums to source valuable information and ask questions.

8. Find a solution with a single command center, implement automation whenever possible, and ensure that it can be remotely accessed 24/7.

9. You can take a few low effort steps to dramatically increase the security of your data, like: automate security updates, automate backups, install operating system updates (which often include better security), use firewalls, etc.

10. Begin by defining the necessary data you want to collect (again, align the information needed to the business goal). Cleanse data regularly and when it is collected from different sources, organise and normalise it before uploading it into any tool for analysis. Once you have your data uniform and cleansed, you can segment it for better analysis.

11. The only solution to adhere to compliance and regulation is to be informed and well-educated on the topic. There’s no way around it other than learning because in this case, ignorance is most certainly not bliss as it carries both financial and reputational risk to your business. If you are unsure of any regulations or compliance you should consult expert legal and accounting firms specialising in those rules.

12. Whether this means having a consistent reporting structure or a dedicated analytics team, be sure to turn your data into measurable outcomes. This means taking data and transforming into actions for the business to take in an effort to produce wins for the company.  

13. This is achievable by creating projections from the get go of introducing data and data management tools. Make sure that you select a robust data solution and know in advance that it can handle the capabilities you may need down the line. Another option is to rely on support systems and internal teams to manage aspects of growth. For example, you can define milestones for your team to be aware of so that only when you reach them will you consider moving to a more sophisticated system.

14. It sounds simple, but it’s not done enough - integrate your data. Set clear expectations and create a unified system that can handle each department’s needs. If it’s not through finding a single integrated system, consider using APIs so that data is accessible in one, centralised location.

15. While you can’t stop progression, you can prepare for it. This begins with staying informed of information technology and its new features, products and threats.

16. If the solution doesn’t exist naturally, try to create it. While you can’t control how many data scientists and data analysts graduate each year, you can leverage your current workforce and provide training to instil and teach the skills you need them to have. You can also look for more powerful data tools that make the analysis work less complex, which open up recruitment to a broader pool of less specialised analysts.

17. It has many way to solve this problem including: 
Consolidation: Combining the data from various sources in one consolidated data store
Propagation: Leveraging applications to copy data from one location to another
Federation: Using a virtual database to create a model to match data from different systems
Virtualisation: Viewing data in one location, but where the data is still stored separately

18. The solution for problems with large data sets, regardless of their exact size, has been discussed throughout this article and include tactics that are performed by both human resources and technology. Steps to properly process data, regardless of its size, include ensuring data is accurate, integrating data, and developing a company culture that both understands and celebrates the usage of big data to make informed decisions.

19. Incorporate data systems with advanced machine learning and interoperability in order to adapt to the constantly changing landscape of data inputs, and in turn, outputs. You can also use systems that store historic as well as new data to understand the causes and implications of the data changes and model future trends.

## Date
N/A

## Problem
1. Keeping Systems Synced
2. Comparing Apples to Oranges 
3. Duplicate Data Entry & Queries
4. Underutilizing Data
5. Incorrect Data
6. Security Challenges

## Solution
1. Real-Time Data Streaming:
One of the most common ways to solve this problem is to institute real-time data streaming. That means instead of data pulling into your business intelligence system at intervals, such as once a day or once a week, the data pulls immediately. For most data management systems, this is a standard and automated process.

2. Data Organization & Translation:
This comparison problem is solved by having a system to organize and translate data into something that can interact more collaboratively for reporting and analytics. Data organization and translation are at the heart of data management. The right tools and expertise can create protocols for organizing and translating data automatically without the need for manual interpretation.

3. Recognize Potential Variations & Trigger Corrective Action:
Depending on the structure of your data, there is likely a pattern of variations that can be identified. The right data management platform will be able to recognize these variations and automatically trigger corrective actions. This helps keep your data as clean and accurate as possible.

4. Data Visualization, Platform Support, & Training:
There are several solutions to this data management problem. The first is to ensure you have proper, easy-to-use dashboard tools in place. These are tools that provide visual reports to those people who will utilize the information and allow queries and analysis in a user-friendly space.

5. Better Processes:
The easiest solution to this issue is to implement better data processes. This means defining roles and expectations, naming conventions or taxonomies, timeframes, etc. With more specific processes in place, it can be easier to prevent data issues as well as to identify and resolve them more quickly.

6. Know the Regulations & Implement Processes:
Depending on the type of data you are managing, there may be regulations in place that dictate how your data should be managed. Examples include financial, personal, or medical information. You should keep apprised of these regulations and ensure your data management techniques help to protect this information—and protect you from liability. In addition, you should implement processes such as data governance that put controls in place for who can access the data and where. Finally, you should have a backup and disaster recovery plan in place that ensures that if data is compromised, it can be identified and resolved quickly.

## Title
5 Common Data Integration Challenges (And How to Solve Them)

## Source Type
Blog

## Author
Luna Campos

## Date

## Problem
1. You have disparate data formats and sources
2. Your data isn't available where it needs to be
3. You have low-quality or outdated data
4. You're using the wrong integration software for your needs
5. You have too much data

## Solution
1. Clean up your data: 
-Remove duplicates using a de-duplicator tool or built-in options in your applications.
-Scan for outdated or invalid data like bounced emails, invalid phone numbers, and misspelled contacts. Remove this data.
-Optimize data collection channels by removing unnecessary information fields from forms and only collecting necessary data.
-Ensure compliance with data protection policies like GDPR.

2. Introduce clear processes for data management:
Implementing company-wide standards for data entry and maintenance is crucial. Designate a specific team or individual responsible for data ownership, ensuring that all data entering the system adheres to company policies and strategy.If assigning a dedicated team is not possible, provide comprehensive training to all employees on proper data input and updates. Educate them on the interconnectedness of your tools.By establishing standardized protocols across the organization, you can effectively minimize the presence of low-quality, outdated, or duplicated data in your system.

3. Back up your data:
Before moving on to the actual data integration, an important -- and often overlooked — step is to back up your data. Your applications may already offer an option to back up your data, so check that this is possible with your software provider. You can back it up to the cloud or do a physical hard drive - or even both, if you want to be extra safe. Once your data is cleaned up and backed up, you can move on to the actual integration.

4. Choose the right software to assist you with data integration:
Having the right integration software to fit your needs is essential. It automates a huge part of your data management tasks and automatically syncs data between the applications in your software stack, drastically reducing the need for manual data entry, unifying data formats, and reducing the scope for error.Integration software is the string that ties everything together in your stack. It ensures a continuous flow of data between different applications and makes sure that each team has access to the right information at the right time.

5. Manage and maintain your data:
Data management is an ongoing process: you still need to check in on your databases every so often to make sure everything is running smoothly, ensure that your team is following the correct processes, check if your existing tools are working as well as they should, and determine if any parts of your strategy need to be updated or adapted. This is especially important if your business is growing - your data integration strategy will likely need to evolve with you as you grow.

Top 7 Causes of Data Loss and How to Combat Them

## Source Type

## Author
Tracy Rock

## Date

## Problem
1. Human error
2. Natural disasters
3. Hardware failure
4. Ransomware, viruses and other malware
5. Software failure
6. Migration errors
7. Malicious deletion


## Solution
1. For faster recoveries, with fewer hiccups, choose a data backup system that allows you to quickly recover individual files and folders, in addition to larger datasets from a recovery point.

2. Make sure your data is backed up to the cloud, in addition to your on-site systems. This ensures that your data can always be recovered, even if your on-site backups can’t.

3. If you can’t afford to lose any data, then deploy BDR technology that allows for a more frequent backup schedule. This will allow you to set an aggressive Recovery Point Objective (RPO), so that your data loss after a hardware malfunction is minimal.

4. Use business-grade anti-virus and anti-malware protection and make sure it updates automatically, every day.

5. Patch your software and O/S frequently by installing the latest updates as soon as they become available. This can greatly reduce the bugs and system errors that lead to data loss.

6. Always back up your data before migration, especially if you’ll be moving large amounts of data. This should be a new, one-time backup that is outside of your regular backup schedule.

7. Practice the rule of “least privilege.” This is the idea that each user should only have access to the files/folders they need to perform their jobs. So if any malicious deletion occurs, it will be limited to those folders.
