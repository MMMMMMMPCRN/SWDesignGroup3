## Problem

1. Storage
2. Container mobility
3. The people problem
4. Containers aren’t designed to be stateful
5. Quality of service controls

## Solution

1. Decoupling storage - Solving this challenge requires rethinking your approach to data storage by decoupling it from apps and host environments. Instead of storing data within the app environment, cloud-native workflows store it externally and offer the data as a service. Then, as workloads that need to access the data, they simply connect to it just as they would connect to any other service.
2. Keep data agile - Depending on your orchestrator, your data has to follow your container around wherever it moves around the cluster. Don’t map containers to specific hosts for your data, because then you lose the mobility and the portability of containers.
3. Integration - For storage, ensure that everything is API-driven, and as integrated with Docker and Kubernetes as possible.
4. Local volumes - In a case like this, we mount a directory from the host onto the containers, which can then access and both read and write to them. This lets you mitigate faster than write to your local host. Because that volume is tied to a specific host however, your data is inaccessible if the host goes down. Be very careful with consistency when you have more than one container write to the same volume.
5. Volume plugins - To resolve these limitations, Docker came up with a new way to integrate external storage: Volume plugins. Volume plugins are a virtualization layer that runs top of any commodity or cloud storage. From the point of view of the app container, volumes are accessible exactly the same way, across the entire cluster, and the storage is always highly available. They are designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes–new nodes contribute their storage into the storage pool. If nodes don’t have storage themselves, can easily access storage on other nodes.

5 Research Data Storage Problems (and Tips) in Research Data Management

## Problem 

1. Difficulty in finding data
2. Data loss or unauthorized access
3. Barrier for interoperability
4. Lack of data persistence
5. Long-term preservation is lacking

## Solution

1. you need a research data storage solution that allows others to easily find the data. Your solution needs to be able to have your research data be described with human- and machine-readable metadata, assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier, and have this metadata registered and searchable.
2. A research data storage solution should be secured against unauthorised access as well as accidents or disasters. Your solution should allow your research data to be stored based on policies and enable open access through a federated identity system. For research data that’s still evolving, you need a solution that’s flexible enough for making changes or updating your research data. If data is already finalised and stable, you need a data archiving system that ensures that if your primary storage goes down, then you have a way of restoring data in case of accidents. 
3. For research data to be interoperable, your research data storage system should support the use of commonly used controlled vocabularies, ontologies, thesauri, resolvable globally unique and persistent identifiers, and a good data model.
4. To achieve persistence for your research data, you need a research data storage solution which supports the sharing of your research data PIDs. Even in the most popular cloud storage systems today PIDs are not part of their features. Make sure that your storage solution has a way to support the assignment of PIDs. 
5. To ensure long-term preservation of your research data, you need to ensure that you have a data management policy that takes into account best practises and a compatible data archiving system. This gives you the tools to follow procedures and guarantees your data is safe and will be available for future reference.

## Problem 

1. Infrastructure
2. Cost
3. Security
4. UI and Accessibility
5. Compatibility
6. Scale

## Solution

1. Storage can be on fixed disks, RAID equipment, solid-state disk storage, remote cloud-based storage and many other devices.
2. Focus the evaluation to eliminate nonessential data collection., Reduce the frequency of data collection., Use available data., Reduce the sample size., Use cheaper data collection methods.
3. One of the simplest best practices for data security is ensuring users have unique, strong passwords. Without central management and enforcement, many users will use easily guessable passwords or use the same password for many different services.
4. N/A
5. The optimal solution is to deploy the software in independent packages that are self-sufficient and contain their own run-time environment. When dependencies are platform agnostic, you will be able to achieve portability and flexibility.
6. To make data pipelines more scalable, you should employ automation technology to find, classify, and ingest data. You also need scalable big data storage, an end-to-end system, and data monitoring to ensure peak efficiency and secure data.
