## problem
1. Humongous Data Storage volume
2. Growing Data Types and Data Sources
3. Too Many Data Storage Mediums
4. Legacy IT Architectures
5. Data Corruption

### solution for problem 1. 
 implement sound data and email archival policies to manage vast data volume
### solution for problem 2.
Structured data, such as relational databases or data warehouses, can be stored in traditional database systems
### solution for problem 3. 
Use technologies like Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) or data virtualization to unify data from different storage mediums into a single, unified view.
### solution for problem 4.
Using Cloud storage system
### solution for problem 5. 
Backing up the data

## problem
1.unreadable data problems
2.Recreating the data storage problem
3.Resolving SCSI device problems
4.Checking the server activity log to resolve data storage issues
5.Checking HELP for messages issued for a data storage problem
6.Resolving data storage errors related to reading or writing to a device
7.Changing the storage hierarchy to resolve data storage problems
8.Changing the server policies to resolve data storage problems
9.Resolving a data storage backup or copy problem that occurs only with a specific node
10.Resolving a data storage problem that occurs only for a specific volume
11.Hints and tips for storage
12.Resolving sequential media volume (tape) errors through messages ANR0542W or ANR8778W


### solution for problem 1. You might receive unreadable data during import or node replication processes related to a lack of code page conversion during these processes.
### solution for problem 2. If a problem can be easily or consistently recreated, it might be possible to isolate the cause of the problem to a specific sequence of events.
### solution for problem 3. Tape drives and libraries might report information back to IBM Spectrum Protect about the error encountered. This information is reported in one or more of the messages.

## Decision Driver
If a problem can be easily or consistently recreated, it might be possible to isolate the cause of the problem to a specific sequence of events.
