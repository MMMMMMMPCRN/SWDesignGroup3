## Title
9 Data Quality Problems and their Solutions

## Source type
Article

## Author type
Tech Insights for Professionals

## Date
Tuesday, April 25, 2023

## Problem
1. Duplicated data
2. Inconsistent formats
3. Incomplete information
4. Multiple units and languages
5. Data overload
6. Inaccurate data
7. Ambiguous data
8. Data imprecision 
9. Invalid data

#### Solution for Problem 1 : 
Use Data deduplication tools
#### Solution for Problem 2 : 
Specify exact formats for every piece of data to ensure consistency across every source your organization uses.
#### Solution for Problem 3 : 
Ensuring records can't be created unless all essential information is included or Setting up systems to exclude incomplete entries
#### Solution for Problem 4 :
N/A
#### Solution for Problem 5 :
Predictive data quality solutions can provide continuous data quality across multiple sources, without requiring data movement or extraction. It offers fully automatic profiling, outlier detection, schema change detection, and pattern analysis to help make sense of large volumes of data.
#### Solution for Problem 6 : 
Using automation tools to reduce the amount of manual work when moving data between systems is also hugely useful in reducing the risk of mistakes by tired or bored workers.Using automation tools to reduce the amount of manual work when moving data between systems is also hugely useful in reducing the risk of mistakes by tired or bored workers.
#### Solution for Problem 7 :
Predictive data quality utilizes autogenerated rules to continuously monitor and quickly resolve ambiguity by identifying issues as they occur.
#### Solution for Problem 8 :
AI-based solutions offer better ways for detailing data by bringing visibility into datasets so teams get a closer insight into granular outcomes at scale.
#### Solution for Problem 9 :
Organizations must spend time and resources managing these issues by establishing measures

## Problem
1. Large, Multi-dimensional Objects.
2. Multi-dimensional and Temporal Indexing
3. Query Mechanisms and Optimization

#### Solution for Problem 1 : 
Associative clustering

#### Solution for Problem 2 :
There is a lack of effective support for multi-dimensional and temporal indexing techniques in existingdatabase systems. Moreover, simply adding one or two popular indexing methods, such as n-dimensional R-trees, is only a limited solution awaiting situations where a completely different index is needed. 
Instead, the ability to incorporate one’s own indexing mechanism
into the data management system is clearly called for.

The Top 4 Data Storage Challenges in 2021

## Source type
News Blogs

## Author type
Tess Hanna

## Problem
1. Data Security
2. Scalability
3. Data Accessibility
4. Data Protection

#### Solution for Problem 1 :
Encrypts data at rest and in motion

#### Solution for Problem 2 :
Adding circuit boards to servers, more servers or standalone storage devices, or storage through an alternate data center or third-party managed storage provider in the cloud. Third-party storage providers are typically able to easily deliver scalability without the need for investments in additional racks, floor space, or storage devices, making them a cost-effective option.

### Solution for Problem 3 : 
Implement security measures such as encryption within the data storage platform. 

### Solution for Problem 4 : 
Use data protection software application.
